"[IMP] mail: add button to generate a mail with ChatGPT

Currently, the user can use ChatGPT to generate text inside the Odoo
editor using the /chatgpt command. Most users don't know that the command
exists. To showcase the feature, we will add a button to the mail composer
modal footer that will open a ChatGPT prompt dialog. The user will then
be able to type a prompt and insert a ChatGPT response to the mail body.
