* Set header indicating product origin

This commit updates the elasticsearch client to set a header indicating which

elastic API version header. The use of static factory methods for that make the
test setup fairly convoluted. I think (with the help of copilot) i've figured
out a way to mock everything, but it feels fairly complex.
