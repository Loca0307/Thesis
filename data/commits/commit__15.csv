"Add files via upload

### How Microsoft Copilot Assisted My EventEase Development

**Activity 1: Event Card Component Generation**
I used Microsoft Copilot to generate the `EventCard.razor` component, which included fields like event name, date, location, and description. Copilot helped set up the structure with proper two-way data binding using `@bind`, making it easier to capture user input dynamically.

**Activity 2: Debugging and Optimization**
Copilot provided helpful suggestions when I encountered data binding issues, especially with nullable values. It also pointed out missing lifecycle methods, such as `OnInitializedAsync()`, which resolved some state-related errors. I also used Copilot to guide my input validation logic ‚Äî ensuring empty fields couldn't be submitted.

**Activity 3: Advanced Features**
Copilot assisted in building out advanced routing for pages like `/register`, `/tracker`, and `/eventlist`. It also helped implement session state management using dependency injection, so user sessions could persist across components. I used it to build an attendance tracking component with toggle functionality to mark attendees.

Overall, Copilot helped me write code faster and with fewer bugs, especially for repetitive tasks like setting up forms, routes, and bindings. It acted as a second set of eyes while still allowing me to stay in control of my code logic.",Thebestman2025,2025-03-26T18:57:59.000-04:00,https://github.com/Thebestman2025/EventEase-BlazorApp./commit/80a2ff5bebee43112f0dae950b00e51ccd7397c8
