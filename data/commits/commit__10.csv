"HW1 for Tech16 

In the notebook
1) **We call OpenAI API** using an API key. We default to the GPT 3.5 model to keep costs down.
2) **We query ChatGPT** with a user specified message
3) **We ask ChatGPT to write a 500 word essay** on a user specified topic. Since the criteria for the essay might be arbitrary also, we ask ChatGPT to first identify helpful criteria when writing such an essay.
4) **We ask ChatGPT to summarize a document** and use a sample 500 word essay as input text
5) **We ask ChatGPT to compare two documents** and use two 500 word essays from related topics as input and their original essay-writing criteria as context to compare and contrast both documents.

a) US vs Indian government
b) US vs Indian financial systems
c) Meta vs Google companies",thisisRMak,2025-02-12T03:43:32.000-08:00,https://github.com/thisisRMak/2025-tech16-LLM/commit/8df5a7a8da2b620958f8eb195f75437738ab2c60

"Table extraction problem attempted fix

This is my attempt at addressing the table problem. I had some success but it is not perfect. I tried it only on ING's report.

It works by:
1) First going through all the pages of the report
2) Converts the page into an image stored in memory
3) Uses a table extractor to identify the position of tables in the page
4) If it finds one (or more) with high confidence, it gets the position of the table in the picture
5) The picture is then cropped to keep only the table
6) The picture moves from memory to a stored folder

-------- The above takes approximately 1s/page of the report --------

7) We then give the pictures to a Multimodal LLM (I used llama scout through Groq. It needs an API key but you can get one for free. Mine was free as well. Watch out for the limits though)
8) I asked ChatGPT to write a system prompt for the LLM  so that it turns the picture into CSV format
9) The CSV format is then turned into a DataFrame

Complex tables are not dealt with very well but for the majority of the tables, it produces good results. Maybe the system prompt needs a bit of tweaking but I think it is a good start.",Thalis Milisios,2025-05-02T21:32:55.000+02:00,https://github.com/kambatzis/BAN_Bachelors_Thesis_Team_11/commit/6777c192be428d81fd7c97cde544cc8c55e0b654

I started this project trying to get chatgpt to write the whole thing for me. BIG MISTAKE. I had at one time a functional program but needed some more features, 12 hours and 2500 chatgpt queries later im left with this mess. will be fixing this in my free time but feel free to help or give me some tips",guyfawkes69,2023-03-04T12:21:16.000-07:00,https://github.com/SupremeSkriptKiddie/Decoder/commit/ce58789eb663c7a96557101524d715a923bc2c6b

"[REF] knowledge: update the action helper and the template picker dialog

This commit uses the new editor features and embedded components for the action
helper and the template picker.

The template picker now uses the HtmlViewer to display prefabricated articles
with embedded components, which can be used as the default value for an article
and automatically create related article items.

The action helper provides a menu to help the user start using Knowledge.
Features such as: inserting a template, an embedded view for article items,
using ChatGPT to write content.

"added a new XML Parser for Geek API

got ChatGPT to write us a parser to convert the XML we were getting into usable JSON rather than dealing with separate arrays of objects...

This should come in handy if we do decide to carry on with the geek API as I know it is better suited to our needs",Clark Oake,2023-04-29T14:57:32.000-02:30,https://github.com/mwhancock/game-shelf/commit/f5f16d8af501208c45eb7b0ace718893cd4c22c7
"Create AIGeneratedWindowsHardening

Created by asking ChatGPT to write me a powershell script using the following prompt. Instead of writing a complete script it seems to get stuck partway through and then seems to get confused about where it left off, and so has a lot of repeats.

Please write me a powershell script to harden a windows system according to Microsoft's hardening guidelines",fadedgreenpeace,2023-01-08T15:15:33.000-06:00,https://github.com/fadedgreenpeace/Public/commit/f59354629753e98916df94949402db39b58a749a
"There are a few ways to do regex it turns out. You can learn the patterns, ask ChatGPT to write them for you, or brute force a bunch of different options and form a frankenstein's monster of patterns that technically works.

"Remove dependencies, format, simplify, coverage, black,

- Generate coverage reports
- Remove numpy, beartype as dependencies
- Move prevalence to its own script
- Use chatGPT to write more concise, less buggy code
- Use `black` package to reformat scripts
- Use .loc and .copy to avoid chain indexing and chain indexing assignment errors",shaunporwal,2023-02-05T17:20:27.000-05:00,https://github.com/MSKCC-Epi-Bio/dcurves/commit/a4fce89e22064b44c3dcf0925a718d443fa30e6b
"Fixed bugs in Stack and created test suite

The Stack class had no __ at the end of the __setitem__ function, so the index assigning and fetching would not work, these were also improperly indented by accident.

Also, used chatgpt to write the test cases for the Stack class, as writing test cases is the most mind numbingly boring thing to do when writing code.",George Tait,2023-06-29T10:20:46.000+01:00,https://github.com/GeorgeTait848/ElementaryDataStructures/commit/4d76aa669ea371e9fb2b1a1c3bb1705a2ce24239
"lots of post-AI refactoring. added args support with the fn creator;
- added args in fn creator and execution; should work. needing the proper imports sucks though. I wonder if I can pre-load imports somehow, maybe there's a lib for that
- AI is still magnitudes faster at writing simple logic like this. it just seems to get a little wrapped up if you give it too much to do at once
  - seems to help to give it the current files; don't expect it to keep context with the changes. just copy/paste it w/ the prompt
  - it can read images and deduce some issues but I didn't find this helpful. possibly helpful when describing layout editing help?
  - this time around I did more manual cleanup. it was definitely much slower progress compared to full on AI generation
  - I think if I'm stricter with my prompts I can get ChatGPT to write things more the way I want them the first time around
  - it was able to fix a bug when I copy/pasted the controller + service that was getting an issue on the backend.
TODO:
- should have a checklist or something in a readme for my TODOs
- need to fix 'edit' feature for functions; all it does is open a new fn creator
- make default functions; something for a tcp send/receive and a kafka send/receive. so the scripts will need to know about the connection stuff. that'll be interesting
- add file import to the connections
- toggle a 'send only' mode so you can just send stuff out if you want; I'll probably implement this and the test case serializing first before doing the test case/assertion stuff.",ashfordhill,2024-08-19T22:24:53.000-05:00,https://github.com/ashfordhill/dynamic-integration-tester/commit/4550c60c0e7db78bd5be4dc043767a94309352ed
"separated Normal and Threaded algos

This commit separates the normal and threaded algorithms in the home page of the application, by creating two separate sections for them. This improves the organization and readability of the page by grouping similar algorithms together and making it clear which algorithms are threaded and which are not. Additionally, this change allows for easier future expansion, as new algorithms can be added to the appropriate section without disrupting the existing layout (yes i asked chatGPT to write this commit message)",Haroon,2023-01-26T16:43:53.000+05:00,https://github.com/notwld/Scheduler/commit/4f89035ccb8060f12bab3c565f0b19bd0df6882a
