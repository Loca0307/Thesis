"Add files via upload

python tutorial_manager.py Or double-click the .exe file in the dist folder

💡 Why I Made This
As someone who learns a lot from YouTube tutorials and online content, I wanted a way to organize everything better. I had the idea for a tool — but no coding knowledge.

I shared that idea with ChatGPT, and together we:

Designed the features

Built the interface

Handled the logic and storage

Fixed bugs and polished the experience

If I can do it this way, anyone can. 💪

🤖 Built With the Help of ChatGPT
This app wouldn’t exist without ChatGPT. Every line of code, every layout tweak, every bug fix — all done step-by-step by asking questions, trying solutions, and learning along the way.
