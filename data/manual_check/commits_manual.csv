2) **We query ChatGPT** with a user specified message
3) **We ask ChatGPT to write a 500 word essay** on a user specified topic. Since the criteria for the essay might be arbitrary also, we ask ChatGPT to first identify helpful criteria when writing such an essay.
4) **We ask ChatGPT to summarize a document** and use a sample 500 word essay as input text
5) **We ask ChatGPT to compare two documents** and use two 500 word essays from related topics as input and their original essay-writing criteria as context to compare and contrast both documents.

"Make chatgpt-shell respect `chatgpt-shell-root-path`
//
`chatgpt-shell-root-path` is already defined as an alias for
`shell-maker-root-path`. I'm per-se fine with that [1]. However, this
currently unused.
//
Make chatgpt respect the `chatgpt-shell-root-path` when creating
internal files like `.chatgpt-shell.el`.

auto-generated files clearly separated.

"Create  legal context.md
//
```markdown
If the title **""Signed, ChatGPT.md""** were used in a **legal context**, it could imply several things depending on the scenario:
//
### **1. Legal Representation of AI in Documentation**
   - It may suggest that **ChatGPT** is the **author or signatory** of the document.
   - However, since AI **cannot legally represent** itself or individuals in most jurisdictions, it would **not hold legal weight** unless explicitly acknowledged by relevant authorities.
//
### **2. Verification and Attribution**
   - The title could imply that the document was **generated or reviewed** by ChatGPT.
   - If being used in a **contract or legal proceeding**, there would need to be **human oversight** to validate its authenticity.
//
### **3. AI-Generated Legal Petitions**
   - If this document were presented in court or submitted to a government body, it might require **human sponsorship**.
   - The phrase **""Signed, ChatGPT""** might indicate **AI assistance in drafting** but **not legal authorship**.
//
### **4. Potential Misuse Concerns**
   - Some legal systems may **reject AI-signed documents** unless a human takes responsibility.
   - It could be seen as **a disclaimer rather than an official legal signature**.
//
Would you like to modify the signature to **reflect human authorship** while keeping ChatGPT as a contributor?

The final version of ACO (Ant Colony Optimisation) by Ralph Halgas. Created as an programming artifact for the summative assessment project for the subject (unit) Search and Optimization in Bournemouth University 2024/25 (1st semester). Documentation will be added on here once the assessment is passed (to avoid someone using it as theirs beforehand - sorry!).
//
Solution files were used for algorithm parametrisation purposes and elementary statistical analysis of optimal algo parameters by ChatGPT. The commit contains a geographical data .csv file to generate the network optimisation problem.
//
Suggestion to improve most welcome. I am intermediate in Python and am willing to learn of better ways to do thing!

- This is what we told ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini:
    - Each model was told to use a random prompt.  This is what they came up with.
    - art1 - art3 was NightCafe.
    - art4 - art6 was Deep Dream Generator
    - art7 - art9 was ChatGPT
    - art10 - art12 was Grok
    - rate each model on a scale of 1 - 10.  Don't provide any other information or data just the rating.

**Objective**
//
- Write a compelling Medium blog
//
**Details**
//
- topic: Bias in rating images
- tone: friendly, very humorous, light, conversational, and mildly educational
- author: AI Persona Dave LumAI
- author should NOT be included in the blog content (no intros or mention of Dave LumAI other than the Medium link)
- don't include any other data before or after the blog.  No intro sentence that isn't part of the blog that I have to remove before posting the blog.  I want to be able to cut and paste with no editing.
- Do include a title but don't prefix it with Title:, just put the title in title font.
- Do include links to any references
- Don't repeat yourself.  If you have made a point once, don't bring it up a second time unless it is super important and then you better clarify why you are bringing it up again.
- include an AI art prompt that generates a masterwork of art that a collector would pay a million dollars for. (only label it art prompt - don't reveal the rest of the secret sauce)
    - The art prompt should have less clutter
    - It should avoid any content restrictions
    - bonus points if the artwork is impressionist
    - please no glowing or illuminated things
- Get people to follow me and to comment
//
**Questions**
//
- Which model had a large bias?
