/*
 * Warehouse is a class that extends SimState and represents a simulation of a warehouse.
 * It initializes the simulation with a given seed and file paths,
 * reads the warehouse configuration from a file,
 * and manages the agents, tasks, and the warehouse environment.
 * It also provides methods for moving agents, and checking for walls or occupied spaces.
 * The class also includes methods for scoring and running the simulation.
 * It uses the MASON simulation library for agent-based modeling.
